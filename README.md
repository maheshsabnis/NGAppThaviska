Generate package.json using command

- npm init -y
- package.json
  - dependencies
    - Runtime Dependencies on Production
      - Included in Production Build int the file 'vendor.js'
      - external Dependencis of angular are Build into 'polyfills.js'
      - Angular 7.0 +
        - The vendor.js is merged and minified in the application production file
          - main.js/app.js
    - npm install --save <PACKAGE-NAME>
  - devDependencies
    - Used for dev/testing
    - npm install --save-dev <PACKAGE-NAME>
  - scripts
    - Build/Test/Run the application

<input type="text" id="txt" value="ABC"/> value is static
--> value is HTML DOM attribute

document.getElementById('txt').value = "PQR"; value is dynamic
--> value is DOM property

Attribuite + Property ==> Property Binding

<input type="text" id="txt" [value]="<PUBLIC-MEMBER-FROM-COMPONENT>"/>
[value], [href], [ckecked], [disabled]

Event Binding
<input type="button" (click)="<PUBLIC-METHOD-FROM-COMPONENT>"/>

Property Binding + Event Binding ==> Two-Way Binding
[(ngModel)]

import FormsModule from @angular/forms in import array of NgModule applied on AppModule

Interpolation AKA Exptression Binding, Read-Only binding of String Memebrs of Component to UI Element
\*\*Note: Expression Binding will Auto-Transform the Members values into string
Syntax -->
{{<PUBLIC-PROPERTY-FROM-COMPONENT>}}

   ==================================================================
   Angular FUnctionaly Reusability
3. Model Classes
   Class Obj =new Class(A(B(C())))
4. Services
   1. Class with @Injectable() decorator from @angular/core

=====================================================================

Day 5: Exercise

1. Create three components, the first component has to show list of customers with following properties in table
   1. CustomerId, CustomerName, City, Email, ContactNumber
2. The second componeent will show orders by customer with following data properties in table
   1. OrderId, OrderName, Date, CustomerId, Order Quantity, Amount
3. The third component that will be a search component with UI as SearchTextBox
4. The application will behave as follows
   1. When the customer is selected from customers component the order component will show all orders by customer
   2. When the customer name is searched from the search Textbox, the customer component will show that customer details and the Orders component will show all orders by thet customer, if the city name is entered in the search textbox then all customers from that ciryt must be displayed in the customers component and all orders for all customers from customer component should be displayed in orders component.

@angular/common/http

1. HttpClientModule
   1. Register the 'HttpClient' class in global scope of the current angular application.
      1. HttpClient class is used to make get/post/put/delete calls to externaly hosted REST APIs
         1. get<T>/post<T>/put<T>/delete<T>
            1. T can be, primptive type
            2. T can be array
            3. T can be BLOB and ArrayBuffer --> Http 2
         2. Observable<T> is a response from each http method
            1. Observable is a stream storage (?) from rxjs lib.
               1. The storage where the async response is stored that is received from the REST API
      2. The HttpClient is a Singleton object registered by HttpClientModule class

Final Problem Statement

1. Create a Component Test that will make sure that the following DOM UI is generated when events are fired
   1. When the Save button is clicked, the table should show the new last row with newly added product data
   2. If the ProductId is repeated then the border-color of the TextBox should be read and the <div></div> tag shows the error message as 'Product Id is already present'
